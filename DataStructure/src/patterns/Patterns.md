### Patterns

- All patterns have nested loop.
    - The outer loop is specifically for the lines.
    - Inner loop are for the colums.
    - for the outer loop count number of lines.
    - for the inner loop , focus on colums and connect them to the rows.
    - print them inside the inner loop
    - Observe symmetry (Optional Applicapble to some patterns)
